## Accumulator Level control

- e can empty the system faster than we can fill it up. This is because we empty using the pump discharge pressure and fill it using only the return line pressure.
## Valve Sizing

- For $Cv$ sizing, the valve should be sized so that when it is $\phi$ _low open, it give the lower bound of controllability $Cv$ and when it is $\phi$_upper  open, it give the upper bound of the $Cv$s which lie in the controllability range.
## Thermosiphon

- The saturated gas is condensed by the HX and the static head is used as a pump. There exists a mass flow for which the circulation can be sustained. It is calculated iteratively

## Electrical Heaters

- [ ] The NV is tuned so that there is flow through the heaters.
