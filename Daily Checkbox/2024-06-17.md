- [x] Keep Ph constant and step the valve PosR from the steady state to find the heat transfer dynamics. (The gain can go to zero if the inlet of the pump becomes two phase)
- [x] Without flow through, CV5x40 control becomes more involved
- [ ] Do parametric test for the above in 10 bar steps
- [ ] And load to zero and check the sub cooling
- [ ] Have controller in regulation and step h
