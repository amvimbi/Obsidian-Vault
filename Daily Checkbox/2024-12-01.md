- [x] The controllers were in PosR (by manual intervention)
- [x] The flow, dP vs lift story (Now the cv =0.7 and the dP is excessive) The detector resistance is fixed by flow requirements.
- [x] The load was being stepped independently
- [x] Valve
- [x] January
- [x] Plot the thing on the board 
- [x] make a component in MATLAB similar to UNICOS that you will feed the data as a CSV to compare behaviors. (On hold to ask about implicit definitions) (Resolved to do it in EcosimPro)
	- [x] Verify same as MATLAB(Scrapped)
	- [x] Retrieve the PID parameters from timer
	- [x] Feed CVs of UNICOS
