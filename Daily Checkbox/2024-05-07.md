# Demo Simulations Review

## Code Review to align Demo Sim PCO with PLC Logic

 T2PACL Transition Logic

- Rename `Tr1` to `P1_t31` to be consistent with PLC convention
- Remove the `is_backup` test and add `accu is_main_plant` instead
- Seperate accu and plant runorder and check in the plant TL and wherever needed in line with PLC Logic
- Pump SC no symmetric ( take the min)
- He uses `P1_T33_TON` parameter which he uses to prevent step skipping (ask Loic)
- Compress DTC SHC switch logic to a function
- Add T2PACL to S2PACL switch, remember to set step to operation
- Add SHC/DTC switch to pump-run T2PACL
