# Swap simulation

- [ ]  After swap, P9 CV1a16 of demo is basically 0%, but sims are at ~30% 
* [ ] Amandla to do steady-state calculation of how much we expect valve to be open. (**On hold**)
- [ ] Pre-swap P9 flow is wrong. Sims have more than twice the flow. 
* [ ] **Amandla to play with P9 pump gain to match both CV and mDot**
* [x] Experimental data to be plotted with Butterworth filter → fewer excitations vs sgolay.
# Re-takeover simulation

- [ ] Re-takeover _starts_ ten minutes earlier.
- [x] Alignment to be checked by Amandla 
# Comparison vs experiment

- [x] Simulation script to be put on EOS → investigation by me
- [ ] Momentum equation → 6 min vs 1 hour? Difficult to imagine.
- [ ] Bart for updated script files for MATLAB -Timber
- [x] Amandla to implement a simplified model with mDot sources and a mDot sink (P1)/ Pressure sink (P9) and NRVs. The idea is to have faster feedback loops
